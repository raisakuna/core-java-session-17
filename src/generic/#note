Introduced in Java 5.
Mainly used fo collections where parameter type for the Collection are specified

Used for the following reasons
1. Provide type safety
    String []s = new String[3];
    s[0] = "abc";
    s[1] =1; // It will shows an error on compile time because we are storing only String value not the numeric

    ArrayList s = new ArrayList();
    s.add("abc");
    s.add(1); // It won't shows an error


2. Resolve type casting
    String []s = new String[3];
    s[0]="abc";
    s[1] ="pqr";
    String value = s[1] // It won't shows an error because "value" is also string and s[1] is also string
    and it won't need any type casting in the above example
    But
    ArrayList a = new ArrayList();
    a1.add("pqr");
    String value=  a1.get[0]; -> will shows a CE because what we are doing here is storing string value with object

    String value =(String)a1.get[0];
