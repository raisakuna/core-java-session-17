Q. write down steps to create immutable class. What is the importance of immutable class?

Immutable class in java means that unchangeable object, once an object is created, we cannot change its state.
e.g. Wrapper class, String, etc.

# Steps to create an Immutable Class in Java
1. Declare the class as final, so it can't be extended by other class.
2. Make all the fields of the class private so that direct access to the data member is not allowed.
3. Make all the fields of the class final so that it's value don't get changed after the object creation
4. A parameterized constructor should initialize all the fields performing a  deep copy so that data member can't be modified
 with an object reference.
5. Avoid providing setter methods to modify the state of the object after creation.


# Main importance of creating immutable class
1. Thread Safety: Since immutable object's state cannot be modified after creation, they can be shared safely across multiple
    threads without the risk of concurrent modification issues.
2. Security: Immutability helps prevent accidental or malicious modification of data potentially improving the security of an
    application.
3. Functional Programming: In functional programming paradigms, where immutability is often emphasized,
    immutable classes are particularly useful for representing data structures and values.
